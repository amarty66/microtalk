# microtalk

The {lambda way} project is a light framework built on a wiki, {lambda tank}, coming with a true functional programming language, {lambda talk}, which is here: http://lambdaway.free.fr/lambdaspeech/.

{micro talk} is {lambda talk} where the engine is reduced to its minimum, two special forms, [lambda, def] and no built-in primitive.

1) out of braces words are just words,
2) functions are created using {lambda {args} expression}, 
3) expressions are named using {def name expression},

So syntax is straitghtforward but you must build everything by yourself ... 

But with such a reduced set of rules you can create data structures, pairs & lists, a control structure, recursion, and then begin to play with lists, display them, reverse them, count their elements (in a very old numeral system using pipes ...). You could build true numbers and a set of related operators, [+,*,-,/,%], compute factorials, play with Hano√Ø Towers and much more, theoretically ad libitum.
