# microtalk
microtalk is a fork of lambdatalk (http://epsilonwiki.free.fr/alphawiki_2/?view=foundations) which can be used out of alphawiki++ (http://epsilonwiki.free.fr/alphawiki_2/) via a simple HTML file. 

With about 750 lines microtalk.js is reduced to a dictionary of 112 primitive functions (HTML, maths, booleans, pairs, lists, SVG, ...), to three main special forms [if,lambda,def] and three sugar forms [let,q,'].

Microtalk can be tested here: http://epsilonwiki.free.fr/alphawiki_2/?view=microtalk or in your computer with the files index.html and mictotalk.js.
